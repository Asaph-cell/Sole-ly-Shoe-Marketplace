## Implementation Notes

### Using Supabase Edge Functions:
1. Create function in `supabase/functions/send-email/`
2. Use Resend, SendGrid, or Postmark API
3. Trigger from database webhooks or directly from application

### Environment Variables Needed:
```
EMAIL_SERVICE_API_KEY=your_api_key
FROM_EMAIL=noreply@solely.co.ke
SUPPORT_EMAIL=support@solely.co.ke
```

### Recommended Service:
- **Resend** (easiest Supabase integration, modern)
- **SendGrid** (reliable, good free tier)
- **Postmark** (excellent deliverability)

### Triggers:
- **Payout Email**: After payout status = 'paid' in payouts table
- **New Order**: After order status = 'pending' created
- **Shipped**: After order status = 'shipped'  
- **Payment Failed**: After payment status = 'failed'
